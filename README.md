# IBS_SCS
This repository contains the original Java source files used in the paper introducing the IBS_SCS algorithm for the Shortest Common Super-sequence problem:
Mousavi, S. R., Bahri, F., & Tabataba, F. S. (2012). An enhanced beam search algorithm for the Shortest Common Supersequence Problem. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 25(3), 457-467.

The Run.java file is to run two algorithms (to compared them): DR and IBS_SCS, in DR.java and IBS_SCS.java files.

Information about the DR algorithm may be found in:
Ning, K., & Leong, H. W. (2006). Towards a better solution to the shortest common supersequence problem: the deposition and reduction algorithm. BMC bioinformatics, 7, 1-11.

Comments and questions about IBS_SCS or these java files may be emailed to seyed_r_mousavi@yahoo.com (as long as alive).
